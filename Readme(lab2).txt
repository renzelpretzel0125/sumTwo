The runtime complexity would be considered n^2 due to the first for loop that searches through the sum array through i in "n" times and the second for loop would search through sum array j though another n times making it take n^2

The spacetime complexity is just 1 as the array is assigned and the array outputed has a only one answer rather than n times so its just 1
